# next-firebase-google-auth App

I started this project to practice `NextJs` and `firebase` Authentication.

This time using `google` authentication pop up.

Users can click a sign in button and a popup will display the google authentication.
Once signed in, users will be greeted by a message using their display name and
they will be able to see the sign out button.

Sign in button will also disappear if the user is signed in

`Demo will be hosted on Vercel`
